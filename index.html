<p>
I am currently a first year Master's student in the Elmore Family College of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

My undergraduate was at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Sciences.

My undergraduate research focused on Machine Learning in the Material Sciences & Engineering Department. I worked on configuring the CD-VAE Project under Professor Dane Morgan and Dr.Benjamin Afflerbach

This was followed by research on the LDOS Project where I worked on Machine Learning for Systems under Professor Michael Swift.

This also included a Software Engineering Internship at a California based consulting firm.

Research Interests:
    I am broadly involved in AI-Systems co-design research.

Specfically, I enjoy optimizng ML workloads through Systems for ML, Hardware for ML and configuring Model Architectures.
