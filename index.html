I am currently a first year Master's student in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.
</p>
I received my undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I graduated with a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Sciences.
<p>
My undergraduate research focused on Machine Learning in the Material Sciences & Engineering Department. I worked on configuring a CD-VAE for material combination generation under Professor Dane Morgan and Dr Benjamin Afflerbach.
</p>
This was followed by research on the LDOS Project where I worked on Machine Learning (ML) for Systems under Professor Michael Swift.
The results of our research was submitted to EUROSYS 2026 (approval pending).
<p>
This also included a Software Engineering internship at a California based consulting firm.
</p>
<p>
I am currently on the onlook for internship opportunities this summer.
</p>
